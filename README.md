# Excel_Vindra_Store_Analysis
I leveraged Excel to create a comprehensive dashboard that analyzed Vindra Store's sales data in 2022.
This project provided key insights into customer demographics, purchasing trends, and top-performing channels.
Notably, the analysis revealed that women comprised approximately 65% of the customer base, highlighting a significant  market segment.

Insights:
1. Women are more likely to buy compared to Men(~65%)
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3
3. Adult age group(30-49yrs) is max contributing(~50%)
4. Amazon, Filpkart and Myntra channels are max contributing(~80%)
